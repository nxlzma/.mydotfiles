# .mydotfiles

My collection of dot files. Used on **Debian 12.5.0** with **Z-shell** as default shell. <br>
Mainly **behavior and appearance** as well as **aliases**, **functions**.

Repository also contains basic **Bash-related** files with proper settings. <br>
As well as **pwsh-related** files, due to fact that I am using **Z-shell** and **pwsh** alternately.

## Cautions
Works only when [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) is installed and used!
